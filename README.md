# Currency_Converter

A simple currency converter application for the Android Platform. The user can switch between nine different currencies and see the exchange to the latest update. The first time the app is ran, the conversions are being calculated using the offline JSON file stored in the application's resource folder (/raw/). While the use is using the app, the currencies are being updated in the background.

The UI is created solely on Fragments, making it more flexible for future iterations of the design (responsive design etc).
